# Torudo

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/torudo.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/torudo)

A terminal-based todo.txt viewer and manager written in Rust with TUI interface.

## Features

- Interactive TUI interface for browsing todo.txt files
- Project-based column view for organized task management
- **Priority-based sorting**: Todos are automatically sorted by priority (A, B, C) then by file line number
- **Dynamic text wrapping**: Long todo titles automatically wrap to multiple lines for full visibility
- **Smart setup**: Prompts to create missing directories and files on first run
- Vim integration for editing individual todo items
- Real-time file watching for automatic updates
- Support for todo.txt format with priorities, projects, and contexts
- Task completion with automatic archiving to done.txt

## Installation

### From crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
cargo install torudo
```

After installation, make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH, then you can run:

```bash
torudo
```

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maedana/torudo.git
cd torudo
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/torudo`.

## Configuration

Torudo uses environment variables for configuration:

- `TODOTXT_DIR`: Directory containing your todo.txt file (default: `~/todotxt`)
- `NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS`: Neovim socket path for vim integration (default: `/tmp/nvim.sock`)

## Usage

### First Time Setup

When you run Torudo for the first time, it will check for the required directory and files:

1. If `~/todotxt` directory doesn't exist, it will ask permission to create it
2. If `todo.txt` doesn't exist, it will ask permission to create an empty file
3. If you decline either creation, the application will exit

This ensures you have control over where your todo files are stored.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run torudo (looks for todo.txt in $TODOTXT_DIR or ~/todotxt)
torudo

# Run with debug mode for detailed logging
torudo -d
```

### Keyboard Controls

- `j/k`: Navigate up/down within a project column
- `h/l`: Switch between project columns
- `x`: Mark selected todo as complete and move to done.txt
- `r`: Reload todo.txt file
- `q`: Quit application

### Todo.txt Format

Torudo supports the standard todo.txt format:

```
(A) Call Mom +family @phone
x 2024-01-15 2024-01-10 (B) Review quarterly report +work @office
(C) Buy groceries +personal @errands
Learn Rust programming +learning @coding id:abc123
```

Features supported:
- Priority levels: `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`
- Completion status: `x` prefix with completion date
- Creation date: `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Projects: `+project_name`
- Contexts: `@context_name`
- Unique IDs: `id:unique_identifier` (automatically added if missing)

### Todo Sorting

Todos are automatically sorted within each project column using the following priority:

1. **Priority level**: (A) items first, then (B), then (C)
2. **File line number**: Within the same priority level, todos maintain their original file order

This ensures high-priority items are always visible at the top while preserving your intended ordering for items of the same priority.

### Display Features

**Dynamic Text Wrapping**: Todo titles and descriptions automatically wrap to multiple lines based on the terminal width. This ensures that long todo items are fully visible without truncation, making it easy to read comprehensive task descriptions.

**Smart Height Calculation**: Each todo item's display height is calculated dynamically based on its content length, with a reasonable maximum to prevent excessive screen usage.

### Vim Integration

If you have Neovim running with a socket, Torudo can automatically open todo detail files when navigating. Each todo item can have an associated markdown file in `$TODOTXT_DIR/todos/{id}.md`.

## File Structure

```
~/todotxt/
├── todo.txt          # Main todo file
├── done.txt          # Completed todos
└── todos/            # Individual todo detail files
    ├── abc123.md
    └── def456.md
```

## Development

### Running in Development

```bash
cargo run

# With debug mode
cargo run -- -d
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
cargo clippy
